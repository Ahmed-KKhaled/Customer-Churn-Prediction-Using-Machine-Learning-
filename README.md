🧠 Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. The goal is to help businesses identify customers who are likely to leave, so they can take action to retain them.

The dataset contains customer demographic data, account information, and service usage. After preprocessing and feature engineering, multiple  machine learning models were trained and evaluated, with the best-performing model being used for deployment.
